Suppose you want to test our BST algorithms. What would be some good boundary value test cases?

0 nodes
1 node
10 nodes
100 nodes

Program a test driver for the BST algorithm and execute the operations using the test cases identified in the previous question.

The smallest element in a binary search tree is always found as the leftmost child of the root. Write a method getFirst to return this value, and a method removeFirst to modify the tree so as to remove this value.

With the methods described in the previous question, it is easy to create a data structure that stores values in a BST and implements the Priority Queue interface. Show this implementation, and describe the algorithmic execution time for each of the Priority Queue operations.

Suppose you wanted to add the equals method to our BST class, where two trees are considered to be equal if they have the same elements. What is the complexity of your operation?
